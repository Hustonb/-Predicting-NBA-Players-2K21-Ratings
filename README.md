This repository contains files associated with the "Predicting NBA Playersâ€™ 2K21 Ratings" project worked on by Ben Huston and Eli Standard. This project was done as part of a 6 week long open ended project for an introductory Data Science course at UVM.

The purpose of the "Predicting NBA Player's 2K21 Ratings" writeup was to share our findings, as well as some of the technical details of how we went about reaching that point. Note that only the "Predicting NBA Player's 2K21 Ratings" document was intended as a finished product. The other files included are a zip file which is intended to show the step by step process we followed (via a Jupyter notebook); and allow anyone it interests to run this code themself.

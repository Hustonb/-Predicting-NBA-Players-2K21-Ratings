### Project Description and Motivation:


### Project Process:
I went through the full data science lifecycle with the goal of creating a multiple linear reression model which predicts NBA players' NBA 2K21 ratings given their real NBA statistics. 
1. Scraped and combined data from multiple messy sources: using Python's Beautiful Soup library. 
2. Performed exensive cleaning: leveraging methods ranging from more common to advanced regular expressions.
3. Created numerous visualizations to draw insights from the data: leveraging Matplotlib, seaborn, and NumPy.
4. Trained multiple linear regression models to peform necessary prediction: leveraging scikit-learn package.
5. Evaluated models using R-squared value, validation error, and residual plots.
6. Leveraged permutation testing and hypothesis testing to evaluate feature importance.
7. Documented conclusions and future work to be done.

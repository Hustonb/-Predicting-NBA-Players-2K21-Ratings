# Predicting NBA Players' 2K21 Ratings Using Statistical Modeling.
### Final Product, Project Writeup:
[Predicting NBA Players' 2k21 Rating pdf](https://github.com/Hustonb/Predicting-NBA-Players-2K21-Ratings/blob/main/Predicting%20NBA%20Player's%202K21%20Ratings.pdf)

### Project Description and Motivation:
This project showcases my proficiency in SQL for database design and exploratory data analysis, as well as my data visualization skills in Tableau. 
The premise of this project is that a blogger’s online store has reached out to me to take care of their data modeling and visualization needs. The website isn’t up and running yet, but the user has a list of fields and tables that they will need included in the data model. The user is also requesting that an interactive dashboard is made showing key metrics for her business. The inspiration for this project is my girlfriend’s blog, which she’s in the process of launching.

### Project Process:
Went through the full data science lifecycle with the goal of creating a multiple linear reression model which predicts NBA players NBA 2k21 ratings given their real NBA statistics. 
1. Scraped and combined data from multiple messy sources, using Python's Beautiful Soup library. 
2. Performed exensive cleaning, leveraging methods ranging from more common to advanced regular expressions.
3. Created numerous visualizations to help draw insights from the data, leveraging Matplotlib, seaborn, and NumPy.
4. Trained multiple linear regression models to peform necessary prediction.
5. Evaluated models using R-squared value, validation error, and residual plots.
6. Leveraged permutation testing and hypothesis testing to evaluate feature importance.
7. Documented conclusions and future work to be done. 

### Installing and Executing Scripts:
Note that only the "Predicting NBA Player's 2K21 Ratings" PDF was intended as a finished product. The other files are included as a zip file which is intended to show (via a Jupyter notebook) the step by step process we followed; and allow anyone it interests to run this code for themself. Note yet again that this Jupyter notebook (IPYNB file) isn't well polished and just serves as a demonstration of  the methods we used. If you want to look over this Jupyter Notebook, extract the zip to a folder and then run the IPYNB file.

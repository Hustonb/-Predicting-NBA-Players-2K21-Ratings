# Predicting NBA Players 2K21 Ratings
This repository contains files associated with the "Predicting NBA Playersâ€™ 2K21 Ratings" project worked on by Ben Huston and Eli Standard. This project was made as part of a 6 week long open ended project for an introductory Data Science course at UVM.

The purpose of the included "Predicting NBA Player's 2K21 Ratings" writeup was to share our findings; and act as an overview of the technical details that went into reaching that point. Note that only the "Predicting NBA Player's 2K21 Ratings" document was intended as a finished product. The other files are included as a zip file which is intended to show (via a Jupyter notebook) the step by step process we followed; and allow anyone it interests to run this code themself. Note yet again that this Jupyter notebook (IPYNB file) isn't well polished and just serves as a demonstration of our code and the methods used. We recomend downloading the Jupyter notebook before looking it over: as the dataframes don't display well in github.

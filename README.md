### Project Description and Motivation:
This project first and foremost highlights my grasp of predictive modeling using sports data. Other skills demonstrated in this project include: web scraping, data cleaning, and data visualization. Python is used for this project, with a focus on Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, seaborn, NumPy, and  Beautiful Soup. The motivation for this project is to build models which predict a players rating in the NBA 2k21 video game based on their real NBA statistics.These models (which are based on different sets of statistics) are then compared to come to conclusions about which statistics most heavily influence this rating.

### Project Process:
I went through the full data science lifecycle with the goal of creating a multiple linear reression model which predicts NBA players' NBA 2K21 ratings given their real NBA statistics. 
1. Scraped and combined data from multiple messy sources: using Python's Beautiful Soup library. 
2. Performed exensive cleaning: leveraging methods ranging from more common to advanced regular expressions.
3. Created numerous visualizations to draw insights from the data: leveraging Matplotlib, seaborn, and NumPy.
4. Trained multiple linear regression models to peform necessary prediction: leveraging scikit-learn package.
5. Evaluated models using R-squared value, validation error, and residual plots.
6. Leveraged permutation testing and hypothesis testing to evaluate feature importance.
7. Documented conclusions and future work to be done.
